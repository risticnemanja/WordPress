<p id="viewer-63kno">Website maintenance can impact your businessâ€™s first impressions, SEO strategy, security and sales. Whether youâ€™re a business owner or <a href="https://www.wix.com/start/blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">creating a blog</a>, youâ€™ll want to make sure that when people and search engines land on your site, they will immediately see the benefits of your siteâ€™s offerings â€” or risk losing them. This means that your ability to rein in and retain online interest lies primarily in your website maintenance.</p>
